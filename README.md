project for CS490: Web Info Retrieval class. 

1. Scrap football articles from guardian.co.uk/football.

Future objectives:
- scrap from ESPN
- use Sax XML parsing instead of DOM
- write a scheduler to scrap at every day/hour
- batch insertion to db?
- other sites to consider:
	Telegraph.co.uk
	Reuters/Football
